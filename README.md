#Building

To build run gradlew compile for windows, ./gradlew compile for other operating systems

Note, clean the <buildDir>/site folder after every compliation, but if you get issues do that.
  
  If the compliation is succsesful, you should see something like this

`AMOUNT OF FILES TOUCHED: 3
COMPILED`
  
  If the amount of files touched doesn't equal the amount of files in the pages directory, clean the <buildDir>/site folder and try again.
