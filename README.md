# JektHelloWorld
Hello World/Examples, using the Jekt Web Framework

Note, clean the <buildDir>/site folder after every build, but if you get issues do that.
  
  If the build is succsesful, you should see something like this

`AMOUNT OF FILES TOUCHED: 3
COMPILED`
  
  If the amount of files touched doesn't equal the amount of files in the pages directory, clean the <buildDir>/site folder and try again.
